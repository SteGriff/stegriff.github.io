# Where are FileZilla Site Manager entries stored?

To retrieve FileZilla connection details from an old hard disk or PC, go to  `C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\FileZilla\` and get `sitemanager.xml` or any other settings file you care for. Replace `C` with whatever drive letter you want, and `Username` with your Windows username.
