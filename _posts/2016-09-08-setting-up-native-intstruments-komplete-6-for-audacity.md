# Setting up Native Instruments Komplete 6 for Audacity

Tags: `#GriffWiki`

This is our family guide to setting up a Native Instruments Komplete Audio 6 soundcard with a voice recording mic. It may be of limited use to outsiders ;)

 * Plug the sound card into the PC via USB
 * The lights should come on steady on the sound card;
	 + If they don't, unplug and replug, or try a different USB port.
 * Plug the mic via XLR into channel 1 or 2 and check the connection is good at both ends
 * Set the button for the Mic to INST (INSTrument level is for things with no built-in preamp, like mics and guitar pickups. LINE level is for powered inputs like Keyboards or Drum machines)
 * Switch on the 48V (phantom power) button on the back of the sound card by pressing it in
	 + The light on the mic should come on; if it doesn't, check the XLR connection and that the sound card is able to draw enough power.
 * Turn up the gain knob for the channel you're using. It's better to use the high quality preamp in the soundcard than amps and software amps on the computer, and this should reduce hiss and buzz.

## Things to check

 * Right click the Volume icon, go to Recording devices, and set `Komplete Audio Channel 1|2` to the default recording device
 * In Audacity, select `Komplete Audio Channel 1|2` as the recording device in the top bar. Monitor the level and test it
 * If there is a problem, try switching between Mono and Stereo
 * You may need to close and re-open Audacity
 * Make a test recording and play it back. Tap on the laptop body during the recording to verify that it is not recording using the laptop body mic.
