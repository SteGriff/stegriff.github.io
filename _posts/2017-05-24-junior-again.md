# Junior again

We're [building an extension][ext] at the moment. Dad is the brains, and my wife and I are labourers. It's funny, every time Dad has to remind me again to do something that he's already asked me a dozen times to anticipate in advance, I think to myself "dang!" why didn't I think of that? Examples:

 * Anticipate when I'll need more mortar on the spot board - don't make me ask
 * Same goes for bricks
 * You can't "throw" material off a shovel; turn it down to the ground
 * Get the next wash in the mixer as soon as the last one is out

And as a senior dev, I know just where he's coming from. It reminds me of times when juniors at work don't remember the techniques I showed them a few hours ago... and the previous day. But that's the same for all of us coming into a new trade; the experience is full of "dang" moments. So this brings some things to the fore, for Juniors and Seniors to bear in mind:

## Junior team members

 * Actively recall each technique you've being taught as you practice them
 * Between learning and practicing, write them down or repeat them in your head
 * Don't get frustrated, just keep going, even if you're getting it wrong
 * Be observant, know what to look for, learn to anticipate
 * Be gracious; eschew the feeling that you're being patronized - that's just your pride talking
 
## Senior team members

 * Stay humble in instruction
 * Be patient
 * Understand that things don't always "go in" when you explain them the first time
 * Encourage, don't discourage
 * Reward the good stuff as well as pulling up the bad stuff
 
Lastly, a note to all: take on the ambitious challenges that are just a little uncomfortable and beyond your usual grasp. I think everyone says this stuff - maybe it's a platitude. But the most rewarding thing during the build has been the most challenging. I had a go at bricklaying and the first course is torture when your back isn't used to crouching over the bricks, and you're not good at handling the tools and mortar (and it's raining)... it's a frustrating skill to start up. It was unfun, and there was always the option to give up. But after I took a break and came back to the second and third courses, it was much quicker and more satisfying. So, pushing through was worth it!

I humbly hope my little story helps you out at work, whatever you do :)
