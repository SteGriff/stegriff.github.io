# AngularJS Quick Start Examples

AngularJS is a little out of vogue now because little brother 'Angular' (*just Angular*) has taken over. However, after working with it under duress for a while, I only recently discovered the beauty of AngularJS. I'm not a big fan of starting every new project with the Next Big Framework because it's so tiring, and I don't want to be the clich√© developer who restarts every project a dozen times just to use the latest kit... so, creating some re-usable, self-documenting tooling that lets me reliably deploy AngularJS seemed like a good idea.

When starting a new AngularJS project, I'd always forget where the various bits are supposed to go, so I made myself some quick start examples, and they're on GitHub: [QuickstartAngularJs][source]. To see what I made, you can go visit [QuickstartAngularJs on GitHub Pages][pages]. My favourite is example #2 (screenshot above).

Help yourself, if you're not too cool and busy building everything in Vue, React, Meteor, Polymer... :)
