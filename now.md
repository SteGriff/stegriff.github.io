## Now

I left [Village Software](https://villagesoftware.co.uk) late 2018 and started at [Paymentshield](https://www.paymentshield.co.uk) to work closer to home. It's going well!

This year we are finishing the trimmings of our house extension which we self-built between Feb 17 and Summer 18, and maybe getting on to the garden.

At [Canning Road](https://canningroad.co.uk) we are solidifying a church vision and building excitement for our transformation as people, a church, and a neighbourhood. I want to do more in the neighbourhood, like a homework/code club and a citizens group, so I'm building up the courage and the plan!

## Tech

I'm trying to work 'hacking time' back into my life as I don't get to ride a train for 1h30 any more! After this site is live, anything I get around to will probably start life on my [Glitch](http://glitch.com/@SteGriff).
